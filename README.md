# Coursera Princeton Algorithms
My work for the excellent MOOC taught by Robert Sedgewick at Princeton U and hosted on Coursera.

## Lessons
### 1 - Union-Find

### 2 - Stacks, Queues, and Elementary Sorts
#### Programming Assigment: Deques and Randomized Queues
Create a double sided queue data structure (adds/removes on both ends of queue) and a randomized queue that pops and returns a random item from the data structure.

### 3 - Sorting Algorithms
### Programming Assignment: Collinear Points
